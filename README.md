# Analysing Business Metrics with SQL
## Overview
I utilise mySQL's "classicmodels" database to answer several pertinent business metrics. The database's schema diagram is below:

Using this database, I can answer several questions. These include: the fastest paying customers, the sales rep with the most sales, most ordered product line by country, with subtotals, and others.
