# Analysing Business Metrics with SQL
## Overview
I utilise mySQL's "classicmodels" database to answer various questions that may be asked of that company's data/business analyst. I include the schema diagram below.

Using this database, I can answer several questions. These include: the fastest paying customers, the sales rep with the most sales, most ordered product line by country (with subtotals), and others.
