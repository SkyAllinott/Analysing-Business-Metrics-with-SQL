# Analysing Business Metrics with SQL
## Overview
I utilise mySQL's "classicmodels" database to answer various questions that may be asked of that company's data/business analyst. **All queries and questions can be found in the Analysis.sql file**.

## What techniques do I use?
A few of the techniques I use in these queries are:
1. Multi table (>2) joins
2. Subqueries
3. Stored procedures
4. Window functions
5. Rollups

And many others, which you can see in the Analysis.sql file. 

## What questions do I answer?
Using this database, I can answer several questions. Some examples include: 
1. The fastest paying customers 
2. The sales rep with the most sales
3. Which reps sell more than X sales rep
4. Most ordered product line by country (with subtotals)
5. What's sitting on our shelves and who should we sell it to

And many others which can be found in the Analysis.sql file.
